# Case-Study-Logistical-Application
Case study of the following sequence U𝑛 where  U𝑛+1 = 𝑐U𝑛 (1 − U𝑛) and 𝑐 between 2 and 4

Taking U0 = 0.3 and using a radar chart for 𝑐 = 2.9, we see that the sequence converges to a fix point.

Using a radar chart for 𝑐 = 3.3, we see that the sequence oscillates between two numbers.

For 𝑐 = 3.5, it seems like the sequence oscillates between 4 numbers.

For 𝑐 = 3.564, it seems like the sequence oscillates many numbers but it is hard to distinguish how many as the lines overlap.

For 𝑐 = 3,840, it seems like the sequence oscillates between 3 numbers.
